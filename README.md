# eduSOS

This is a team project for class CS160
For this project I used my github name akassian

This is an Android mobile app for high school students needing homework help.
Students can search for an answer on our forum or live chat with a tutor using our app.

Team Name: Pandas
Andrei Kassiantchouk, Avanthika Ramesh,
Changze Cui, Clark Palmer, Tiffany Ho
Project Title: eduSOS
Representative Tasks:
1. A student can post a question to a question answer forum
on eduSOS and wait for a tutor to eventually reply with an
answer. This method requires the student to not be in a big
rush for an answer and expect a slight delay in response.
2. A student can search for a previously answered question
in the eduSOS database. This is the cheapest option for the
student since it does not require active tutor involvement,
and the answers based on the searched keyword will show
up.
3. A student can chat with an online tutor within eduSOS.
This method is a live conversation and is typically used if
the student is on a time crunch and needs assistance
immediately.
4. On the tutor side of the platform, a tutor can answer a
question in the Q&A forum that has been posted by a
student.
5. A tutor can also open a live chat conversation with an
online student when they are online in the application and
assist within eduSOS.
